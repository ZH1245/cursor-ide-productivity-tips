**All comprehensive rules and guidelines are defined in `Agents.md` in this repository.**

When generating code, you MUST:
1. **Follow Design Principles** - Always apply core design principles (Single Responsibility, DRY, KISS, Separation of Concerns, Composition, Open/Closed) from the [Design Principles](#design-principles) section in `Agents.md`.

2. **Read and follow the rules in `Agents.md`** - This file contains detailed rules for all AI agents including:
   - Design Principles (Single Responsibility, DRY, React patterns, memoization, portals, compound components)
   - API Development Agent
   - Frontend Component Agent
   - Database Schema Agent
   - Testing Agent
   - Security Agent
   - Performance Optimization Agent
   - Documentation Agent
   - Refactoring Agent
   - Migration Agent
   - Code Review Agent
   - Commit Message Agent (commitlint format)

3. **Apply the appropriate agent rules** based on the task at hand. For example:
   - When creating API endpoints → Follow "API Development Agent" rules
   - When building React components → Follow "Frontend Component Agent" rules + Design Principles
   - When writing tests → Follow "Testing Agent" rules
   - When working on security features → Follow "Security Agent" rules
   - When generating commit messages → Follow "Commit Message Agent" rules (commitlint format)
