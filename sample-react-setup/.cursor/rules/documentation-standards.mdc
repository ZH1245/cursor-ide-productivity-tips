# Documentation Standards

## Code Documentation

- **JSDoc Comments**: All exported functions, classes, components, types, and interfaces MUST have JSDoc comments
- **Type Annotations**: Use explicit TypeScript types; avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary
- **Inline Comments**: Explain "why" not "what" - code should be self-documenting

## README Updates

**✅ Update README.md when:**
- Adding new major features or capabilities
- Changing project structure (new folders, significant reorganization)
- Updating tech stack or dependencies
- Adding new setup/installation steps

**❌ Don't update README.md for:**
- Small bug fixes
- Internal refactoring that doesn't change user-facing behavior
- Adding utility functions or helpers
- Minor component additions

## File-Level Documentation

- **File Headers**: Include a brief description at the top of complex files
- **Module Purpose**: Document the purpose and responsibility of each module
