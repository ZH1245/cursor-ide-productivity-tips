# Component Design Patterns

## Compound Component Pattern: When to Use

**✅ Use Compound Components when:**
- Sub-components are used by **parent components** (external composition)
- You need flexible composition where parents can rearrange or customize sub-components
- The component is a reusable library component that needs maximum flexibility

**❌ Don't use Compound Components when:**
- Sub-components are **only used internally** within the same file
- The component structure is fixed and never changes
- You're just organizing code internally (use regular helper components instead)

## Component Organization

**Split into folder when:**
- Component exceeds 300-500 lines
- Component has multiple distinct sub-components
- Component has complex internal state management that can be isolated

**Keep as single file when:**
- Component is simple and under 400 lines
- Component is a single, cohesive unit without distinct sub-sections
- Splitting would create unnecessary complexity

## Folder Structure Pattern

```
components/
├── features/
│   └── navigation/
│       ├── Footer/
│       │   ├── index.tsx          # Main component
│       │   ├── FooterHeader.tsx  # Sub-component
│       │   └── types.ts          # Component-specific types
│       └── Navbar.tsx            # Simple component (single file)
```
