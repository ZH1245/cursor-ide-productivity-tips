# React / Next.js Standards

## Server Components First (SSR/SEO Priority)

**This project prioritizes Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and SEO optimization above all else.**

- **Server Components First**: Default to Server Components; use Client Components only when absolutely necessary
- **SEO-First Thinking**: Every decision should consider SEO impact and server-side rendering benefits
- **Client Components as Last Resort**: Only use `'use client'` when interactivity, browser APIs, or CSS animations require it

### When to Use Server Components (Default)

✅ ALWAYS use Server Components for:
- Data fetching (database queries, API calls)
- Accessing backend resources (file system, environment variables)
- Keeping sensitive information on server (API keys, tokens)
- Large dependencies that should be kept on server
- Static content and layouts
- SEO-critical content (headings, meta tags, structured data)

### When to Use Client Components (Last Resort)

⚠️ ONLY use Client Components when:
- You need interactivity (onClick, onChange, useState, useEffect)
- You need browser APIs (window, document, localStorage, etc.)
- You need React hooks that require client-side
- You need CSS animations that require JavaScript triggers

## Component Organization

- **Split large components (>300 lines) into folders** with sub-components
- **Component-specific types** at end of component files
- **Shared types** in `app/types/` folder
- **No separate `*-client.ts` type files** - all types in main type file

## TypeScript Standards

- Explicit types, avoid `any`
- Component prop types at end of component files
- Compound component types in types folder (only when needed)

## Tailwind CSS

- ✅ Always check [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) before using inline styles
- ✅ Use utility classes or custom utilities via `@utility` directive in `globals.css`
- ❌ Avoid inline `style={{}}` props - use Tailwind classes instead
